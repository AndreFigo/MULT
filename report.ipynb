    "\n",
    "As the quality goes down, there is a somewhat perceptible decrease in detail, especially in zones of the image where there is alternance between light and dark colour within a short range of pixels. This can be explained by the smoothing that is undertaken in JPEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also because of this phenomenon, the contours that the image might have are made less crisp, and some interference between different colours of the respective areas is also verified. This is especcially evident when comparing the original bmp file to the compressed files (mountain-sky interfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "### peppers.jpeg image\n",
    "\n",
    "As is expected, there is also a decrease in detail in this image, as quality decreases. The contours of each vegetable are also affected, but in this case, the smoothing also affects the perceived light reflection coming from the vegetables in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "### logo.jpeg image\n",
    "\n",
    "In this image, which only contains 3 colours, the loss in detail and interference in the various contours is the most evident feature, when analysing different qualities. However, the colour representation within the objects' borders remains accurate, as there is only one colour being represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the most apparent quality losses can be noticed in contours and in zones with sharp colour transitions. However, if we consider the compression rates achieved by this format, the storage required is well exploited to represent the images with maximum detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also verified that the image with the least features (logo.bmp) had the highest compression rate (81.3:1, 25% quality), whereas the image with most details (barn_mountain.bmp) had the lowest one (29.8:1, 25% quality). This leads to the conclusion that detail makes an image harder to compress."
